     abstractNote={Discusses the dependency locality theory (DLT) of human computational resources in sentence parsing that relies on 2 kinds of resource use. One of the key ideas underlying the theory is locality, such that the cost of integrating 2 elements (such as a head and a dependent, or a pronominal referent to its antecedent) depends on the distance between the 2. The remainder of the chapter reviews some empirical observations regarding the proceeding difficulty associated with unambiguous structures. It is shown that the DLT accounts for the complexity effect in these structures as well as preferences in ambiguous structures.

abstract = {Dependency distance, measured by the linear distance between two syntactically related words in a sentence, is generally held as an important index of memory burden and an indicator of syntactic difficulty. Since this constraint of memory is common for all human beings, there may well be a universal preference for dependency distance minimization (DDM) for the sake of reducing memory burden. This human-driven language universal is supported by big data analyses of various corpora that consistently report shorter overall dependency distance in natural languages than in artificial random languages and long-tailed distributions featuring a majority of short dependencies and a minority of long ones. Human languages, as complex systems, seem to have evolved to come up with diverse syntactic patterns under the universal pressure for dependency distance minimization. However, there always exist a small number of long-distance dependencies in natural languages, which may reflect some other biological or functional constraints. Language system may adapt itself to these sporadic long-distance dependencies. It is these universal constraints that have shaped such a rich diversity of syntactic patterns in human languages.}

By exploring the differences in syntactic complexity between writings at different proficiency levels, the study is purposed to find out the measures that can best discriminate and predict writing proficiency. The L2 Syntactic Complexity Analyzer and the dependency syntactically-annotated corpus are used respectively to collect the data for large-grained and fine-grained measures. With regard to large-grained measures, it is found that students with higher writing proficiency tend to produce longer language units, more subordinate clauses, more coordinate clauses, and more noun phrases in their writings; mean length of T-unit, mean length of sentence, and dependent clauses per clause can better predict writing proficiency than other traditional large-grained measures. As for fine-grained measures, it is found that three types of subordinate clauses, that is, adverbial clauses, complement clauses and relative clauses, and two types of noun modifiers, that is, prepositional phrases and adjectival relative clauses, occur more frequently in the writings of more proficient learners; the frequency of compound nouns correlates negatively with writing proficiency.}

Our study addresses these concerns by comparing several implementations of prominent sentence processing theories on an exploratory corpus and evaluating the most successful of these on a confirmatory corpus, using a new self-paced reading corpus of seemingly natural narratives constructed to contain an unusually high proportion of memory-intensive constructions. We show highly significant and complementary broad-coverage latency effects both for predictors based on the Dependency Locality Theory and for predictors based on a left-corner parsing model of sentence processing. Our results indicate that memory access during sentence processing does take time, but suggest that stimuli requiring many memory access events may be necessary in order to observe the effect."

We demonstrate the generalizability and robustness of models using such a broad complexity feature set across writing topics."

This article proposes a simple, coherent view of the construct, which is defined in a purely structural way, i.e. the complexity directly arising from the number of linguistic elements and their interrelationships. Issues of cognitive cost (difficulty) or developmental dynamics (acquisition) are explicitly excluded from this theoretical definition and its operationalization. The article discusses how the complexity of an interlanguage system can be assessed based on the limited samples with which SLA researchers usually work. For the areas of morphology, syntax and the lexicon, some measures are proposed that are coherent with the purely structural view advocated, and issues related to their operationalization are critically scrutinized. }

The papers are divided into three thematic sections that reflect the central themes of the book: Typology and theory, Contact and change, Creoles and pidgins. The book is mainly intended for typologists, historical linguists, contact linguists and creolists, as well as all linguists interested in language complexity in general.

This analysis allows us to investigate the impact of sampling condition on the relationship between syntactic complexity and language development, to identify measures that significantly differentiate between developmental levels, to determine the magnitude at which between-level differences in each measure reach statistical significance, to assess the pattern of development associated with each measure, and to examine the strength of the relationship between different pairs of measures.

Second, aggregating available cross‐sectional findings, I propose critical magnitudes for between‐proficiency differences in syntactic complexity for four measures. Finally, I interpret the limited longitudinal evidence to suggest that an observation period of roughly a year of college‐level instruction is probably needed for substantial changes in the syntactic complexity of L2 writing to be observed.

abstract = {ABSTRACT This study explores the development of multiple dimensions of linguistic complexity in the writing of beginning learners of German both as a group and as individuals. The data come from an annotated, longitudinal learner corpus. The development of lexicogrammatical complexity is explored at 2 intersections: (a) between cross-sectional trendlines and the individual development paths of 2 focal learners and (b) between different complexity variables. The study contributes to the empirical body of linguistic complexity research by close tracking of beginning learners over 4 semesters of collegiate study of German as a second language (L2). For this purpose, data for multiple variables were collected at dense time intervals using multiple waves, and correlation analysis between various datasets was performed. The results confirm some general developmental trends established in previous research. However, the study also found significant variability between individual and cross-sectional data. Furthermore, differences found for more specific complexity measures between this study's results and previous research are explained in terms of differences in instructional approaches. In addition, the study contributes to the discussion of methods and metrics appropriate for tracking the development of complexity in foreign language writing. The study concludes with implications for L2 pedagogy and further research, including applications of computational methods.},

abstract = {Large-scale learner corpora collected from online language learning platforms, such as the EF-Cambridge Open Language Database (EFCAMDAT), provide opportunities to analyze learner data at an unprecedented scale. However, interpreting the learner language in such corpora requires a precise understanding of tasks: How does the prompt and input of a task and its functional requirements influence task-based linguistic performance? This question is vital for making large-scale task-based corpora fruitful for second language acquisition research. We explore the issue through an analysis of selected tasks in EFCAMDAT and the complexity and accuracy of the language they elicit.},
