EGP equivalent for Japanese additional validation of forms used.
% Things that went wrong/were difficult shortfalls

Ideas: explore-accommodation for the third domain - Fluency (possibly using timing??)  Focus on Accuracy together...

More accurate analysis of clauses needed to answer additional questions about development of clausal complexity

This tool could also be useful for approximating the JLPT level a learner should take.

better analysis of てform? i.e. coordinate clauses, it is included in the grammar forms connected with other parts
but not on its own. The use of てform most likely makes up a good percentage of the coordinate clauses. (even through
the て is marked as SCONJ)
