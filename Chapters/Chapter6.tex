% Where the research questions answered? - % summarize findings briefly again.
This study set out to investigate which linguistic complexity measures and critierial features best reflect
developmental changes across L2 Japanese proficiency levels, and whether such features could be used to build an
interpretable, data-drive classification model.

%3. To assess whether linguistic complexity features and/or Criterial Features can reliably predict proficiency
%levels in L2 Japaneselearners.
The EBM classifier achieved an overall accuracy of 38\% outperforming the 20\% for five-class classification. While
this reflects only moderate predictive power, it underscores the inherent challenge of fine-grained proficiency
classification, especially between adjacent JLPT leves. Notably, performance improved substantially when levels were
grouped into broader categories, with an F1 score of .54. This result points to the continuum-like nature of the
JLPT scale, suggesting that its proficiency bads are not as discrete in practice as their labels imply. The small
number of N1 texts also limited classificaiton accuracy at the advanced level.

Feature important analysis revealed that syntactic complexity (coordinate clause measures) and lexical
sophistication (JLPT vocabulary percentages), and Morphological complexity measures (MCI JRMA MATTR) were the primary
drivers of
classification. This alsigns with findings
in prior linguistic complexity studies which show that as learners progress, their linguistic output becomes more
sophisticated in terms of sentence structure and vocabulary. However, despite the clear importance of these features,
the overall classification accuracy suggests that the current set of features, may not fully capture the
fine-grained distinctions required for highly accurate multi-level classification. Especially as learner errors
which have also been investigated alongside as a domain of Criterial features have not been implemented in this study.


%2. To examine how linguistic complexity features and criterial features develop across different proficiencylevels
%in Japanese learners.
Aligning with previous studies as proficiency increases learners use more "parts" in their writings so sentence
length and clause length increases and diversity of vocabulary also increases. Mean Hierarchtical distance and mean
dependcy distance
also increases meaning
that more complex embedding is done in sentences.


%1. To identify which linguistic complexity measures, and criterial features show reliability as indices of language
%development in L2 Japanese learners.




% additional research areas/exploration.
EGP equivalent for Japanese additional validation of forms used.

Ideas: explore-accommodation for the third domain - Fluency (possibly using timing??)  Focus on Accuracy together...

More accurate analysis of clauses needed to answer additional questions about development of clausal complexity

This tool could also be useful for approximating the JLPT level a learner should take.

better analysis of てform? i.e. coordinate clauses, it is included in the grammar forms connected with other parts
but not on its own. The use of てform most likely makes up a good percentage of the coordinate clauses. (even through
the て is marked as SCONJ)
