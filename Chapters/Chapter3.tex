\chapter{Methodology}
define  features that I will use for classification how I decided on this and motivation behind these features.
Also how I will train a model for classification 


\section{About corpus}
information about the corpus organization, prepossessing

\subsection{J-CAT test}

\section{Complexity Measures}
detail the complexity measures I will use, how I developed the scripts to automatically "extract them" and the statistical significance between the proficiency levels
list, Sent Length, Clauses per sentence, Noun phrase length,  Subordination, coordination, 

\section{Criterial Features}

\section{Automatic Error Annotation}

Explain how I will do this so that I will further be able to extract criterial features to examine
 - Automated Error Detection?
    can I apply an LLM to check each sentence, and then use distance measure to classify errors 
    -what about discourse errors? I have a feeling these will not be caught by an LLM...
        disregard discourse errors.
 - Which type of errors will I annotate for? 
        - Automated detection of particle errors - using work?


\section{Design of the Classification Models}
Which Architecture?

One system just for Criterial features, One for Complexity features, and One for both. 

Random Forest or Explainable boosting machine
