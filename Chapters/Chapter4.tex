\chapter{Evaluation} 
Here is where I will evaluate the initial results of The data I collected noting statistics regarding the Developmental
trajectories
\section{Complexity Measures}

Findings from the complexity measures I am using
Do they show an overall developmental trajectory?
list, Sent Length, Clauses per sentence, Noun phrase length,  Subordination, coordination, MTLD, NP length

Which features discriminated between proficiency levels?
Is a developmental trajectory apparent across proficency levels?

\subsection{Syntactic Complexity Measures}
\subsubsection{Sentence Level}


\subsubsection{Clause Level Analysis}

\subsection{Lexical}
CTTR and LFP , MTLD

\subsection{Morphological}


\section{Criterial Features}
Raw counts of features, 
look at how many of structures from each level are used across all features used


possibly also include qualitative analysis on extracted grammar forms.?

\section{Task Effect}
Look into differences in results across tasks...
