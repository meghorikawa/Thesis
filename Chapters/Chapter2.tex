%What do I need to know to

\section{Linguistic Complexity}
What is complexity? How it is defined? Different types

Previous work on Syntactic complexity measures as indices for proficiency levels of other languages.
introduce the different measures and define them.
Syntactic, Lexical features

\subsection{Linguistic Complexity in SLA}
set definition of complexity - syntactic, lexical etc.
role of it in proficentcy research
other usess such as readability etc.
role of learner corpora?

Include:
Language Developmental Trajectory
Research of non-english languages
Previous research of Complexity in Japanese
Challenges of previous research - including Japanese


\subsection{Measuring Complexity}
Sentence Length, Clause Length, Clauses per sentence, NP length, Subordination, coordination, MTLD instead of CTTR...
Other lengths of measures and theories behind them. Describe which measures are measuring what Also shortfalls of the
measures


Frequency of forms as a form of syntactic sophistication \cite{Ellis2004}
%

\subsection{Computational approaches}
tecniques used in NLP for calculating the complexity measures - different systems that exist
uses/applications in ICALL systems




Notes from Detmar:
You are right that some studies look at accuracy and at
complexity. However, it is perfectly fine to focus only on complexity
- that's a complex enough field, with complexity features as well as
criterial features being potentially interesting. Indeed, the vast
majority of our own work has focused exclusively on complexity (not
accuracy) - cf. http://purl.org/dm/complexity.html

You may need to say something abut the challenge of detecting certain
complexity indicators that may be difficult to identify robustly for
learner texts containing a lot of errors. But it is definitely not the
case that you need to include accuracy analyses in the thesis.


%\section{Criterial features} - gave up on this section due to corpus being uncorrected.
%What are Criterial Features? How are they decided/extracted?

%Types - Negative Positive

%Talk about previous work with EGP proficiency classification,
%% I realize this might not be so important, uless I want to choose  a few of the grammar points to analyze and try to extract....

%\section{Japanese Proficiency Language Test (JPLT)}
%JLPT levels have clear grammatical and lexical goals defined....and can do statements were added later in 2012 to 
%align with other worldwide standard proficiency tests/standards i.e. ACTFL, CEFR

%maybe also introduce some skepticism of the testing methods of the test?

%Introduce can-do statements at each of the levels and also summarize the equivalent test used in the corpus
