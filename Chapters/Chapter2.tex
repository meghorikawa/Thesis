\chapter{Background/Related Work}
\section{Linguistic Complexity}
Previous work on Syntactic complexity measures as indices for proficiency levels of other languages.
introduce the different measures and define them.
Syntactic, Lexical features

\subsection{Complexity Measures}
Sentence Length, Clause Length, Clauses per sentence, NP length, Subordination, coordination, MTLD instead of CTTR...


\section{Criterial features}
What are Criterial Features? How are they decided/extracted?

Types - Negative Positive

Talk about previous work with EGP proficiency classification, Japanese JLPT levels
%% I realize this might not be so important, uless I want to choose  a few of the grammar points to analyze and try to extract....

\section{Japanese Proficiency Language Test (JPLT)}
JLPT levels have clear grammatical and lexical goals defined....and can do statements were added later in 2012 to align with other worldwide standard proficiency tests/standards i.e. ACTFL, CEFR

maybe also introduce some skepticism of the testing methods of the test? 

Introduce can-do statements at each of the levels and also summarize the equivalent test used in the corpus
