In second language acquisition (SLA) research a learner's proficency is analyzed through the triad of domains known
as \textbf{complexity}, \textbf{accuracy}, and \textbf{fluency} (CAF) \cite{Skehan1989,ellis2003}. Each of these
dimensions are treated as key indicators of language development in a learner, with each dimension capturing different
aspects of learner performance. \textbf{Accuracy} is concerned with the extent a learner's language conforms with
the norms of the target language, usually measured by an error rate. While this seems clear-cut, there is
controversy regarding the criteria for evaluating and indentifying errors and how much they should follow
prescriptive norms of the target language \cite{housen2009}. \textbf{Fluency}focuses on the learner's
speed and smoothness of production, measured by counting the rate of production units. Due to the nature of data
needing a time variable, usually oral data is analyzed for these studies. Finally,
\textbf{complexity} is characterized as the ‚Äùthe extent to which the language
produced in performing a task is elaborate
and varied \cite{ellis2003}. Complexity has attracted considerable attention
in studies analysing written language as a proxy for development. However, the concept of complexity itself has
been inconsistently defined, leading to inconsistent findings across studies (this is of course not the only variable).
This underscores the need for more consistent and empirically grounded definition, which may be difficult due to
limitations of independent variables influencing a study such as task conditions, .....

%now I need to provide evidence of inconsistent definitionas of complexity. and then clearly state how I am handling
%this for this thesis...

Definitions of complexity vary across research depending on whether form-based, psycholnguistic, or computational
perspectives are prioritized. To address this reasearchers have proposed further breaking down complextiy into
different domains such as, 'absolute vs relative'\citet{Miestamo2008}, 'linguistic' vs. 'cognitive' \cite{housen2009}, and 'absolute' vs. 'relative' \cite{Butle2012}. Of these the first term, is used to refer to characteristics of the linguistic system and the later for issues of cognitive demand for the speaker/learner sometimes simply reffered to as 'difficulty'. For readbility studies measur

% This thesis adapts a hybrid approach to complexity to account for theoretical depth and the needs of automated
% assesment. Then talk about syntactic, lexical, etc...

\subsection{Linguistic Complexity in SLA}
-Syntactic complexity and lexical measures as indices for proficiency levels of other languages. (Language Developmental Trajectory)
-Use of complexity in SLA studies, readability studies, and ICALL
-role of learner corpora in operationalizing and tracking complexity.
-research on non-English languages
-Existing studies on complexity in L2 Japanese - the the limitations


\subsection{Computational Approaches to Measuring Complexity}
- Introduce major complexity metrics:
    -Syntactic: sentence length, clause density, suboridation, coordination, noun phrases, depedency distance
    - Lexical: type-token ratio (TTR), MTLD, lexical sophistication
-Theoretical basis and interpretation of each measure and limitations
- Use of NLP tools in measuring complexity and automated tools in ICALL applications (CTAP)

\section{Criterial Features}
- Define criterial features: What are they and how they relate to CEFR levels.
- Illustrative descriptors vs. criterial features. (EGP)
- Frequency-based indicators of syntactic sophistication? \cite{Ellis2004}
    - comparison to developmental sequences?
- Examples of criterial features in English (and possible other languages) also describe this in relevance to Japanese
- automated extraction - POLKE


\subsection{Proficiency Assessment Frameworks}
- Overview of CEFR levels ( Is it really necessary to include ACFL?)
- The structure and goals of JLPT (grammar/lexicon targets at each level)
- Historical development of JLPT and inclusing of CEFER-style descriptors from 2012.
- limitations of JLPT, or critiques on standardized tests.
Not sure if this warrants it's own section. Describe proficency assesment measures CEFER, etc. also introduce JLPT
Can-do statements- forms teste


maybe also introduce some skepticism of the testing methods of the test?
Talk about previous work with EGP proficiency classification?
Introduce can-do statements at each of the levels and also summarize the equivalent test used in the corpus?


\section{Automatic Proficency Assesment}
- motivation - describe why automatino is needed
- Overview of existing systems using complexity/criterial features for proficency classification.
- Describe challenges
    - Learner errors impacting feature extraction (decreases robustness)
    -Inconsistent tagging/parsing in morphologically rich or low-resource languages
        -try to find something for Japanese to support some inconsistentices I found when tokenizing sample text
- Describe the aboves' relevance to Japanese, and to this study
